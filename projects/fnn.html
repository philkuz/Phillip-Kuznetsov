    <!-- <p>Aritifical neural networks are artificial intellgience frameworks. The most popular network, the feed-forward, operates on similar principles of the biological neural networks. The input neurons connect to the next layer of neurons through weights, which are homologues of dendrites. These weights are randomly initalized in the network initialization and are adjusted as the network trains. </p>
    <p>Although this is a viable artificial intelligence framework, neural networks fell out of popularity since their creation. This can be attributed to the blackbox relationship between all of the weights. Basically, researchers could use the networks to learn from datasets and approximate functions, however they lacked a clear understanding  of what the weights in a network meant and thus the field fell out of popularity. The purpose of this investigation was to find this relationship through a function.</p>
    <h1 class="section-heading">The Expansion</h1>
    <p>Because artificial neural networks can be represented mathematically, we are able to perform a variety of operations</p>
